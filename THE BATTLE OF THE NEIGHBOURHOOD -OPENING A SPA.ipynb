    "#### Toronto, city, capital of the province of Ontario, southeastern Canada. It is the most populous city in Canada, a multicultural city, #### and the country’s financial and commercial centre. Its location on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario, which forms part of #### the border between Canada and the United States, and its access to Atlantic shipping via the St. Lawrence Seaway and to major #### U.S. industrial centres \n",
    "#### via the Great Lakes have enabled Toronto to become an important international trading centre. \n",
    "#### Since the second half of the 20th century the city has grown phenomenally, from a rather sedate provincial town—“Toronto the #### Good”—to a lively, thriving, cosmopolitan metropolitan area. Area 244 square miles (632 square km); metro. area, 2,280 square #### miles (5,905 square km). Pop. (2011) 2,615,060; metro. area, 5,583,064; (2016) 2,731,571; metro. area, 5,928,040.\n",
    "#### Toronto is an international center of business, finance, arts, and culture, and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and #### cosmopolitan cities in the world. In this report, we will focus on all areas in Toronto. There are some Spas in Toronto, we will #### conclude where are the existing spas. Then we will use a clustering model to find similar areas in Toronto considering\n",
    "#### demographic data of each borough and region. The preferred area shall be distant from existing spas.\n",
    "#### We will use data science tools to fetch the raw data, visualize it then generate a few most promising areas based on the above #### criteria. In the meanwhile, we will also explain the advantage and traits for the candidates, so that stakeholders can make the #### final decision based on the analysis.\n",
